        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- This course focuses on python (python 3.x.x, specifically). Using package managers simplifies the installation and maintenance of libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **Python package manager** is a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing python packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A package managers helps you handle project dependencies, ensuring that a project has all the required libraries at the correct versions to run correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The most common package managers for Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **`pip`:** `pip` is the standard package manager for python. It's the most widely used and comes pre-installed with modern Python versions (3.4+). It's primarily used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is the official third-party software repository for Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **`conda`:** Conda is an open-source, cross-platform package and environment manager. While it can manage Python packages from PyPI, its main strength is that it's language-agnostic. This means it can install and manage packages for Python, R, and other languages, as well as their non-Python dependencies and binary packages (e.g., NumPy and SciPy, which have C and Fortran dependencies). Conda is popular in the data science and scientific computing communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- As I will show during this course, `pip` and `conda` offers several advantages over other managers, which do exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "- To be able to use python and jupyter notebooks in your laptop/PC, you may install Mini/Anaconda.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Anaconda/Miniconda (Recommended, see https://anaconda.org/):\n",
        "\n",
        "- Conda will allow you to have python (and all the libraries you need to analyse your datasets) installed in your laptop/PC.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Anaconda is now very popular because it provides good portability and an interface that allows the user to include extra kernels for other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Anaconda has the advantage that you have all the code you need locally in your laptop. In the long term, using Anaconda will be much more advantageous.\n",
