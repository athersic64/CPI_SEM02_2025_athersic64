        "\n",
        "Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System for tracking changes in source code or any other set of software files.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Control System:** Git is a content tracker.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Version Control System:** Code is constantly changing. Many developers can add code in parallel. Git keeps history of what changes have been implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Branching/Forks:** Git provides features like branches and merges.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Distributed Version Control System:** Git managers, like GitHub, have a remote repository stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## About GitHub\n",
        "\n",
        "- GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git.\n",
        "\n",
        "- GitHub is a company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is an ideal platform to share code with colleagues.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The (rolling-course) CP1 GitHub Repository serves this purpose: https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-1\n",
        "\n",
        "- You have afew options:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Watch:** this helps you view and keep track of all changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Fork:** this creates a mirror version of the repository in your own GitHub accounts.\n",

        "- On Ubuntu:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "1. Go to https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-1\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Open a terminal, navigate to the desired working directory and create a sub-directory. Then, inside the sub-directory:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "git clone https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-1.git\n",

        "\n",
        "Now you have all the current material in your own computer.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "git pull\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Adding and modifying the local repository can be done in your own laptops/PCs. Once you have finished the changes, you can update the remote repository with:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "git add .\n",
        "```\n",
