# Tutorials for IISEM2024

Here are the notebooks to use for the tutorials. While they do, in a very simple way, solve the problem presented, there are many things to correct and improve in almost every single step. Doing and discussing such changes will be the main goal of the tutorials.

**Note**: Below each notebook, youâ€™ll find the intended solution labeled with `...sol.ipynb`.
